Acts 8:1-5 
  There is a scattering that is happening right now
  
### Tide has turned, no one is wanting to come to Church

People are thinking about how their next pay check is going to come or their next meal

Mathew 14:16 - Jesus concerned about their hunger

The best place to help people are places where people congregate.

Which means today, it would be twitter, facebook, instagram etc.

By identifying what people need, we become social investigators who can help architect what God wants to do in this church.

The early church knew how to adapt to changes.

Christians have found it hard to embrace, questioning even whether God wants man to fly, when aeroplance was invented

The harvest is plentiful but people are looking for digital hope Leaders who are unashamed of the Gospel

### Leveraging new language

A core value of the church of the author's church is belonging and have used the word family to describe church

Moving away from a transactional language

In the digital age, we have to rethink the language we use.

Go back to new testament, see Paul's language of familial descriptions - "we are body of christ"

For years we have used language such as we meet here at.. our building is at.. and even now, we miss coming together

But these verbiages don't help in the time of crisis. Reinforce "church is not a place you go" but belong

Worship isn't a gathering to sing song (only).. Romans 12:1 is worship

Discipleship is leading people into a hope-filled life in Christ Jesus. 

### Refocussing on Vision

You know you have lost your vision, when you are trying to compensate what you have lost.

Churches are trying to up the ante, build a better experience and a platform for people who worship.

Most churches have a vision only to how to make Sunday service be good.

If our vision in not bigger than the production we put on, we are going to decline.

Go back to our call to the ministry. Why?

God gives - Vision is built so we don't loose heart in circumstances like COVID-19

On earth as it is in Heaven (Mathew 6:10)

Don't build better mouse traps.

We have to look for what God is doing in response to this pandemic, not what we are doing.

Sometimes vision is Costly. Paul coming to Jerusalem knowing he will be martyred.

Its impossible to do anything worthy dying for, if we don't have a vision from God

Its impossible to build without a vision

## Practical

### Capturing Social attention

People are attracted to "Can you solve my problem"?

If we can present Gospel in such a way that people can relate to Jesus, we have arrived. 

Everything else is just tools that will assist.

People are looking to Solutions

How can I influence the landscape of somebody's heart by presenting Gospel to them in a way that they can undertand.

One of the methods of impact is community engagement, it is like an outreach.

How do we do outreach in a digital world?

Outreach is a form of ministry.

We can start by telling stories - aka testimonies Rev 12:11

If we can tell stories, we can create prophetic culture in our neighbourhood and community when people hear what God is doing.

Can be personal storie of transformation or stories of what the church is doing in the community

Speaking the language of the culture

### Online Experiences

Samples, Craig Grochel, Steven Furtick

Life.Church ? what is it //todo

What do yo want your first time visitor to feel

What do you want them to think 

Who is the ideal person on your website

What do they look like

### Navigating the white noice

What can we learn from underground churches? Life is simple, Discipleship is simple, Church is simple

All of the streaming all of the churches are doing right now, will become white noice to users soon.

It will become white noice to the unchurched.

How can we keep who we are and what we are doing simple

"If it is not simple, it is not reproducible" Andy Stanley

Missional vs Attractional Church

Thinking addressing needs in the community

Rick Warren created profiles of people who they are trying to reach when starting Saddleback

You have to figure quick who you are reaching out via the digital ministry (Narrow down)

Curiosity will catch the Unchurched - Remember moses and the burning bush

Rephrase for your audience

Sermon Title variations "Against all Hope" vs "What does it mean to be against all Hope" or "Have your back been ever against a wall"

### Crowdsourcing Ministry

Most times we start a ministry from where we are instead of where people are.

We have "savior" complexes, determining we know what is best

Impactful ministry is when we join God's invitation to start where people are

Firat thing God asked was "Adam where are you?"

Sometimes, we need to ask that simple question "how can we help" instead of curating a solution for a advertised scenario.

Asking the community "What top struggles or challenges you have"

Allowing community to identify their own needs shows respect for their dignity

Turn your social media campaigns to listening campaigns, ask questions.

### Social Outreach

When our buildings were shutdown, we doubled our services online.

Pivot and Innovate

We Pivot because things happen that are outside of our control

We innovate because we have a God who is control.

### The new mega church

When a crisis hits, people who can help will be sought out

A facebook page with 1600 people is the same medium and capacity,

Harvest is plentiful, we have to shift where our people are.

You are already a mega church pastor, so act in that capacity.

### Digital Discipleship

We need to keep our central focus in making disciples

Every week we have mobilized disciple makers to use Zoom to keep going at it

Five elements of discipleship making. hope, head, heart, hands and help

We can pastor through pandemic, because our early church fathers did it.

The great commission has not changed
