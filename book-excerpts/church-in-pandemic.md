Acts 8:1-5 
  There is a scattering that is happening right now
  
### Tide has turned, no one is wanting to come to Church

People are thinking about how their next pay check is going to come or their next meal

Mathew 14:16 - Jesus concerned about their hunger

The best place to help people are places where people congregate.

Which means today, it would be twitter, facebook, instagram etc.

By identifying what people need, we become social investigators who can help architect what God wants to do in this church.

The early church knew how to adapt to changes.

Christians have found it hard to embrace, questioning even whether God wants man to fly, when aeroplance was invented

The harvest is plentiful but people are looking for digital hope Leaders who are unashamed of the Gospel

### Leveraging new language

A core value of the church of the author's church is belonging and have used the word family to describe church

Moving away from a transactional language

In the digital age, we have to rethink the language we use.

Go back to new testament, see Paul's language of familial descriptions - "we are body of christ"

For years we have used language such as we meet here at.. our building is at.. and even now, we miss coming together

But these verbiages don't help in the time of crisis. Reinforce "church is not a place you go" but belong

Worship isn't a gathering to sing song (only).. Romans 12:1 is worship

Discipleship is leading people into a hope-filled life in Christ Jesus. 

### Refocussing on Vision
