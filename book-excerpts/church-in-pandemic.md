Acts 8:1-5 
  There is a scattering that is happening right now
  
### Tide has turned, no one is wanting to come to Church

People are thinking about how their next pay check is going to come or their next meal

Mathew 14:16 - Jesus concerned about their hunger

The best place to help people are places where people congregate.

Which means today, it would be twitter, facebook, instagram etc.

By identifying what people need, we become social investigators who can help architect what God wants to do in this church.

The early church knew how to adapt to changes.

Christians have found it hard to embrace, questioning even whether God wants man to fly, when aeroplance was invented

The harvest is plentiful but people are looking for digital hope Leaders who are unashamed of the Gospel

### Leveraging new language

A core value of the church of the author's church is belonging and have used the word family to describe church

Moving away from a transactional language

In the digital age, we have to rethink the language we use.

Go back to new testament, see Paul's language of familial descriptions - "we are body of christ"

For years we have used language such as we meet here at.. our building is at.. and even now, we miss coming together

But these verbiages don't help in the time of crisis. Reinforce "church is not a place you go" but belong

Worship isn't a gathering to sing song (only).. Romans 12:1 is worship

Discipleship is leading people into a hope-filled life in Christ Jesus. 

### Refocussing on Vision

You know you have lost your vision, when you are trying to compensate what you have lost.

Churches are trying to up the ante, build a better experience and a platform for people who worship.

Most churches have a vision only to how to make Sunday service be good.

If our vision in not bigger than the production we put on, we are going to decline.

Go back to our call to the ministry. Why?

God gives - Vision is built so we don't loose heart in circumstances like COVID-19

On earth as it is in Heaven (Mathew 6:10)

Don't build better mouse traps.

We have to look for what God is doing in response to this pandemic, not what we are doing.

Sometimes vision is Costly. Paul coming to Jerusalem knowing he will be martyred.

Its impossible to do anything worthy dying for, if we don't have a vision from God

Its impossible to build without a vision

## Practical

### Capturing Social attention

People are attracted to "Can you solve my problem"?

If we can present Gospel in such a way that people can relate to Jesus, we have arrived. 

Everything else is just tools that will assist.

People are looking to Solutions

How can I influence the landscape of somebody's heart by presenting Gospel to them in a way that they can undertand.

One of the methods of impact is community engagement, it is like an outreach.

How do we do outreach in a digital world?

Outreach is a form of ministry.

We can start by telling stories - aka testimonies Rev 12:11

If we can tell stories, we can create prophetic culture in our neighbourhood and community when people hear what God is doing.
